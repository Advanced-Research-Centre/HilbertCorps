**Automated Concept Discovery of Quantum Error Correction Codes**

Quantum computing holds tremendous promise for solving complex problems that are currently intractable using classical computers. However, the potential of quantum computers is limited by the presence of quantum errors that can degrade the fidelity of quantum computations. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes play a pivotal role in mitigating the effects of these errors, ensuring the reliability and scalability of quantum computation. Traditional methods of discovering new QEC codes are often time-consuming and rely heavily on intuition and trial-and-error. To fully unlock the potential of quantum computing, there is a pressing need for an automated approach to discover novel QEC codes efficiently and systematically. The project aims to revolutionize the field of quantum computing by developing a novel automated framework for discovering quantum error correction codes.
